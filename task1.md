    title: MY EXPERIENCE SO FAR IN ZURI TRAINING

    body: I heard about Zuri training from my friend (Diala Egwuchukwu Stephen), he, in turn, got the info from Twitter(i don't know the specific tweet).

    I enrolled and when I got the slack workspace link, it did not work at first, but it was later resolved and I was able to log in the next morning.

    Upon joining the workspace, I was amazed at the sheer number of people in the training, it was 12,000 at the time and it later rose by about 2000 within a day.

    We had to subscribe to the Zuri channel and attend the online orientations as it was being live-streamed on youtube, it was fun, frankly, I only attended the third orientation for the back-end tracking.

    An then there's the games, question and answer sessions in which the fastest answers win, theses served to increase the morale of the participants, afterall as they say, money is the great motivator, i did not win a single game though, but i am hopeful.

    We were then introduced to the learning management system(LMS) we would be using for the duration of the training, we were asked to register, and complete some tasks which lead us to this article I am currently writing, it is listed under task 1 number 4. 

    The End.
